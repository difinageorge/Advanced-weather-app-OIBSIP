# 🌤️ Advanced Weather App - Python

This project was completed as part of my **Python Programming Internship** at **Oasis Infobyte** (Project03). The objective of this task was to create an **advanced weather application with a GUI (Graphical User Interface)** that allows users to fetch and view detailed weather information for any city.

## 🚀 Live Demo

This is a Python-based desktop application, so there is no online demo available. You can download and run the code on your local machine using Python, Tkinter, and Pillow.

---

## 📌 Task Objective

Develop a **GUI-based Python application** that:

* Fetches current weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.  
* Displays **temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition**.  
* Shows **weather icons** dynamically for current conditions.  
* Allows users to choose between **Celsius and Fahrenheit**.  
* Handles invalid inputs and API errors gracefully.  
* Provides a clean and user-friendly interface.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**  
* **Tkinter** – for GUI components  
* **requests** – for API calls  
* **Pillow (PIL)** – for displaying weather icons  
* **OpenWeatherMap API** – for weather data

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository** (or download the ZIP file).

2. **Install the Required Packages**:

```bash
pip install requests pillow
````

3. **Add Your API Key**

* Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `app.py` with your OpenWeatherMap API key.

4. **Run the Application**:

```bash
python app.py
```

5. Enter a city, choose the unit, and click **Get Weather** to view the results.
